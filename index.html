<!--Having had absolutely no experience in CSS or html I took a little time to get going and struggled at the start but found that the relevant css and html aspects were quite straightforward. Some others' code on codepen.io gave me a good idea of how to create the logic for Aces etc as well as stackexchange codereviews to see mistakes others may have made and corrected doing similar projects. I used https://medium.com/@nitinpatel_20236/how-to-shuffle-correctly-shuffle-an-array-in-javascript-15ea3f84bfb for my method to shuffle the card deck. My understanding of some of the components can still be improved so i have been revisiting the links sent in the assignment email.
The first examples i looked at for help were object oriented programming so that is what i went for, although i am now aware that i could have done it more easily with Simple JavaScript, an example of this being https://embed.plnkr.co/plunk/qjVrV3 . 
I wasn't sure how to set up a devspace on my pc so I used github for my code.
I enjoyed doing this project and (hopefully) look forward to doing more like this on the course!-->
